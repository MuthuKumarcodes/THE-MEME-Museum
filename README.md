# THE-MEME-Museum
The Meme Museum is a straightforward Git repository project. It functions as a meme museum, featuring a collection of default memes. Users can contribute by sharing new memes via link-pasting, along with a brief description. Currently lacking a connected database, uploaded memes are not stored anywhere permanently.
